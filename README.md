# World Clock

This is a world clock which shows an azimuthal projection of the world. The night shade is aligned specifically with respect to the position of the earth around the sun (with the summer solstice at the "top" of earth's orbit.) It also shows which sections of the globe are in each weekday. You can scrub forward and backward in time on the map and with some sliders, and set the time and date via an input. It is interesting to see the changes in the sun's illumination throughout the seasons and how each day progresses.

## Development

The rescript wrapper is just so if i decide to port it later.

Run ReScript in dev mode:

```sh
npm run res:dev
```

In another tab, run the Vite dev server:

```sh
npm run dev
```
