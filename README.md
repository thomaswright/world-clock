# World Clock

This is a world clock which shows an azimuthal projection of the world. The night shade is aligned specifically with respect to the position of the earth around the sun (with the summer solstice at the "top" of earth orbit.) It also shows which sections of the globe are in each weekday. You can scrub forward and backward in time: +- 18 hours and +- 180 days. This is cool because you can see how the portion of the earth illuminated by the sun changes as the seasons progress.
